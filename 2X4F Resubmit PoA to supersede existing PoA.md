# **Resubmit PoA to supersede existing PoA**
FP may resubmit a PoA if it was not approved by any Catalyst Team sign-off user. The FP may resubmit a PoA using the Resubmit PoA button.

Resubmitting  PoA means that it will go through the review process again.

Once the PoA is resubmitted, it will be visible on the milestone page, and the previous PoA submission will be archived.

Once the PoA is approved by a Catalyst Team sign-off user, it will be locked. When locked, a PoA can no longer be resubmitted, and the button Resubmit Proof of Achievement  will disappear.
