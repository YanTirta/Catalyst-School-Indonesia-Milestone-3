# **When to submit a Statement of Milestones**
Projects approved for funding must submit a Statement of Milestones in the [Milestone Module](https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/) once voting has concluded and as part of the onboarding process - from the 26th of September to the 2nd of October. In case of a  delay in SoM submission within a given time frame, there is a high risk that FP will not receive the initial batch of funds on time. 


More information on the rules and requirements applicable to the Statement of Milestone in F10 is available here
