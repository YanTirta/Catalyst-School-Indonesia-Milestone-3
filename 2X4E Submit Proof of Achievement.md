# **Submit Proof of Achievement**
FP may begin to submit PoA once every milestone in the SoM is approved by both Milestone Reviewers and by the Catalyst Team sign-off user. The Submit New Proof of Achievement button will appear on the milestone page, along with the field to be filled.

Once the PoA is approved by the Milestone Reviewers, FP will receive a notification in the to-do list/updates, visible on the project dashboard.

If the PoA is not approved, FP will receive a notification in the to-do list/Updates section, visible on the project dashboard.
