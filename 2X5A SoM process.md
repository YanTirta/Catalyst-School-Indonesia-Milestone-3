# **SoM process**
Milestone Reviewers are asked to review all milestones and supporting information and consider whether the SoM sufficiently lays out a clear path to project delivery, based on what was voted for and approved by the Cardano Community during Project Catalystâ€™s governance stage.  

Once Milestone Reviewers have reviewed all milestones in the SoM, they are asked to indicate whether or not the milestones were satisfactory, with supporting comments for the SoM to be included in the project file.
