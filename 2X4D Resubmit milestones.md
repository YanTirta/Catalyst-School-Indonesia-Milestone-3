# **Resubmit milestones**
If there is a refusal, it will be displayed on the project dashboard, and the FP will receive a notification in the [Milestone module](https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/) to-do list/updates area (please note that  FPs wonâ€™t receive this notification via email). 

In such a situation, FP may submit a new milestone to replace the previous one in such a situation by clicking the Resubmit Milestone button. Form to fulfill will appear with a button Clone latest submission, which can be used to prefill the form with previously submitted information. Once a milestone is resubmitted, it will be reviewed again. This feedback loop continues until all reviewers approve it. The Catalyst Team sign-off user locks the milestone for further submissions.

FP can resubmit any milestone within SoM that is not yet closed. Once approved by the Catalyst Team sign-off user, the button to submit the milestone will disappear, and a green Approved by Catalyst Team sign-off user on button will become visible. All previous submissions and related reviews are visible on the project dashboard as an archived version.

Once each milestone is approved by both the Milestone Reviewers and the Catalyst Team, the milestone in the SoM will be locked, and no further changes can be made unless a milestone change request is submitted. 

See this section for more information about submitting change requests.
