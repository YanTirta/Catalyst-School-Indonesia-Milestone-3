# **What do you need to do?**
There are two key tasks for CTs at the onboarding stage  - 
1. Confirm Proof of Life with your project teams (Deadline to complete the PoL [meeting schedule form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_5AotXKwNsglRiml-JMY-EpKm6EUmhLTfFDcwSQZFxeIeLw/viewform) is 20 September 2023)
2. Inform Catalyst once you have confirmed Proof of Life with all of your projectsI

### **Immediate tasks**
* You must confirm Proof of Life (PoL) with your project teams.
  * You can conduct these meetings as you see fit, provided all the requirements outlined in this document are met.
* Without a PoL funded project teams will not receive funding, so this is a critical and essential part of your role during onboarding. 
* You are more than welcome to attend the Funded Projects Town Hall meeting set formally by IO to set the scene for Funded Projects (this is NOT a PoL meeting)
  * F10 Onboarding Session A - 8 AM UTC - 26 September 2023 
  * F10 Onboarding Session B - 5 PM UTC - 26 September 2023
