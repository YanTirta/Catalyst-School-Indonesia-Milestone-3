# **Creating your milestones - need to know**
- A milestone is the planned completion of a significant event in the successful delivery of your project. It is a signal to demonstrate progress.
- Funds are only released on satisfactory completion and delivery of each milestone.  
- Each milestone must be clearly described. For each milestone you must also explain how you intend to evidence the completion of the milestone. 
- Your Statement of Milestones will be made available to view to the Community
- When you have completed a milestone and wish funds to be released you will be asked to provide clear visible evidence of the completion of the milestone. The Milestone Reviewers  are reviewing milestones, and you should expect the Cardano community will also be interested in reviewing these proofs. 

**IMPORTANT:** Each FP will have a number of milestones in the Milestone Module according to requested funds (more information below). FP should inform via email Catalyst Team by September 27th EOD if would like to have additional milestones the Milestone Module

- Your project should have at least 2 milestones and an additional final Milestone: below there is a breakdown of the milestones requirements based on the project grant funds:
