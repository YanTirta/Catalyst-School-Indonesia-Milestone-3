# **Process of checking PoA**
1. FP submits PoA through the [Milestone Module](https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/)
2. Milestone Reviewers check the to-do list/Updates section to see if there is PoA to review
3. First Milestone Reviewer compares if evidence of milestone provided meets the following: expected outputs, acceptance criteria or evidence of completion
- If verified: PoA is approved by first Milestone Reviewer
- If not verified: PoA is not approved by first Milestone Reviewer and feedback for FP is provided in the milestone module and PoA resubmission requested
4. Once first Milestone Reviewer reviews PoA, second Milestone Reviewer makes review
5. Second Milestone Reviewer compares if evidence of milestone provided meets acceptance criteria approved in SoM
- If verified: PoA is approved by the second Milestone Reviewer
- If not verified: PoA is not approved by second Milestone Reviewer, feedback for FP is provided and PoA resubmission requested
6. If one reviewer approves and the other does not, the Funded Projects has to resubmit the PoA taking into account comments provided, and go through the review process again.
7. Catalyst sign off user will sign off PoA if possible
