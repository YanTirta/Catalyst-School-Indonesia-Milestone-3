# **Milestone Reviewer can review a PoA**
Once FP submits a PoA for the milestone, the Milestone Reviewer can review the evidence submitted for PoA. 

Milestone Reviewer will receive notifications in the Milestone module’s To-do list/Updates area

Milestone Reviewers **won’t receive any email notifications.**

Milestone Reviewers must review a PoA using the Open Proof of Achievement button. Once reviewed, the button will disappear from the notifications.

The Open Proof of Achievement button reveals a new field to fulfill.
