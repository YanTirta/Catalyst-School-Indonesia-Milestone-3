# **Funded Project Reporting Guideline**

Every project must submit monthly reports (MRs) to receive their regular tranche payments. This includes projects delivering on milestone-based funding. With adequate reporting, a project can avoid interruption in funding distribution. Every project must report their monthly progress and supply evidence of delivery.
