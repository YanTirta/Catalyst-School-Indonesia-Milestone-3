# **What is not good evidence?**

### General rules
 * The information provided does not clearly show that the milestone has been accomplished.
 * The links submitted do not work, so the project's evidence cannot be effectively verified. 
   * For E.g., Git repo is publicly accessible, which will allow for review
 * The evidence submitted is not in line with the Ideascale proposal
 * The evidence contains project description only, without any progress
 * Evidence is in a different language than English

### Specific evidence
### If image/video is evidence:
 * Quality is poor - unable to watch/see
 * Lack of description

### If code is evidence:
 * It isn’t in the Git repository 
 * Activity in Github doesn’t match what is stated in the milestone

### If presentation/slide is evidence:
 * There is only a project description, no track of any progression 

### If a website is the evidence:
 * There is no clear evidence of new features/updates on the website and their description
