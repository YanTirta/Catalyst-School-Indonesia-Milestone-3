### Onboarding F10 Funded Projects - A guide with actions, checklists, key dates and deadlines

Welcome to Catalyst Funded Projects! Now that voting has ended, your Funded Project (FP) will join hundreds of other Catalyst projects innovating and developing new solutions with the help of Catalyst funding from Cardano Community. 

Your project has three important phases as part of Catalyst:

- Phase 1: Onboarding: Proof of life, Statement of Milestones and Test Tx
- Phase 2: Project Delivery
- Phase 3: Project Completion

This document covers Phase 1: Onboarding. Once you have completed onboarding more information will be provided to you about phases 2 & 3 in the weeks and months following.
