# **Monthly Reporting status changes**

In April 2023, following a period of community consultations, Catalyst implemented some changes to Funded Proposer (FP) communications. FP will have a greater chance of smooth reviews if FP submits Monthly Report (MR) at least five days before the deadline (up until 15th of the month) allowing FP to resubmit MR before the deadline if needed (20th of each month).
- FP may check the status of MR [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wAG5O4PBLRTM01PLUyc3iS9EYOaucyDHryOOG8OVKuk/edit#gid=1828690587). A comment section displays additional context if needed
- There will be following possible status of the MR:

### Approved
- MR is reviewed and approved

### Not reviewed
- The Catalyst Team hasn't started reviewing the MR yet. It will be reviewed within 5 working days

### Approved FP
- The MR is automatically approved due to project completion and FP needs to submit Project Closeout Report and Video

### SoM awaiting project completion
- FP needs to submit a Project Closeout Report and Video and/or final PoA

### Not approved
Below is the list of reasons and their descriptions:
- **Evidence is in a different language than English** - Presently Catalyst has no capacity to evaluate evidence submitted in multiple languages. To that end, evidence should be in English so that Catalyst can easily review it. Please resend the report with Evidence in English. 
- **Submitter provided the same evidence for different reports** - Each report that the FP submitted, should have different evidence. Please resubmit your report again with different evidence for each of them
- **Link to evidence doesn't work** - Catalyst is unable to open the link provided as evidence, please resubmit the report using proper links. Please make sure that Git repo is publicly accessible so that the Catalyst team will be able to check it
- **Evidence is not in line with Ideascale proposal OR SoM**- Evidence is not in line with the section in Ideascale ‘Please provide a detailed plan, including timeline and key milestones for delivering your proposal’ . Please compare what is provided in MR and what is stated in Ideascale with regards to timeline and key deliveries,
Please resubmit your report with evidence that is in line with Ideascale proposal
- **Evidence does not clearly show that work was done in the month of the reporting period** -  It is hard to understand if any progress was achieved within the last month. Please resubmit your report with clear evidence
- **Evidence contains project description only, without any progress** - There is no evidence of the progress accomplished within the last month except for a project description. Please resubmit your report with evidence showing the progress you made within last month
- **Evidence is insufficient and does not clearly show work completed** - The report should clearly describe what was accomplished within the last month and evidence should show accomplishment. Please resubmit your report with clear evidence and its description
- **Report is a duplicate (copy/paste) of another report** -  Each report submitted by a FP should be different. Catalyst compares the current report of each FP with previous ones that the FP submitted. If it is duplicate, it is discarded and not reviewed. Please resubmit your report with new evidence and its description
- **Report was submitted late (After 20th)** - Report was sent after deadline so will not be reviewed
- **Project has completed and needs to submit a project closeout report** - Please follow Project Closeout Report and Project Closeout Video section
- **Evidence is for a different time frame** - The evidence doesn’t show what was accomplished in the last month but it refers to a different timeframe e.g. 2 months earlier. Please resubmit your report with evidence showing progress accomplished within the last month

If the report is submitted much before the deadline and it is not approved, FP will receive an email from Catalyst no-reply account **catalyst-noreply@iohk.io** that MR is not approved and there will be a link to the public spreadsheet and to the section explaining the rejection reasons. This will allow FP to resubmit a new MR. 

Once a project is nearing completion, the final payment will not be released until a Project Closeout Report and Video have been received and verified. FPs will receive an email from Catalyst’s no-reply account asking to submit the closeout report and video.

**From F10** Project Closeout Report and Project Closeout Video will be part of Final Acceptance Milestone. It represents the last step for Funded Projects before their project is considered complete and includes submitting a Project Closeout Report and a Project Closeout Video.

**Please remember that the report has to be resubmitted by the deadline (20th of each month, 23:59 UTC), otherwise the report will not be approved. 5 working days are needed to review MR once submitted. Reports are not reviewed in order of submission date.**
