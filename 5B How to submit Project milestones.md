# **How to submit Project milestones**

>These Guidelines are intended to inform proposers how milestone-based funding works for proposals submitted as part of the Fund 10 cohort.

Milestone-based funding enables projects funded by Project Catalyst (Funded Projects) to lay out their critical path to delivering the promises set out in their proposals, highlighting each key milestone, output, acceptance criteria, costs, and what evidence of achievements will be demonstrated at each stage of the project. In this context, a milestone is an important event or action in any project or business journey that marks a crucial stage of progress. It is a crucial reporting tool to inform the Catalyst team and the community of the project's progress and to ensure the accountability of Funded Projects within a fair and unbiased decentralized funding framework.
