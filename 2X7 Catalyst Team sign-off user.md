# **Catalyst Team sign-off user**
This role constitutes the last part of the process. The Catalyst Team sign-off user performs a general check on the  previous phases. For example, they check for the correct number of reviews and confirm the final result, locking the PoA/SoM so no further changes are possible. Once a PoA is locked, the Catalyst Team can extract the data required to execute subsequent payments to FP.
