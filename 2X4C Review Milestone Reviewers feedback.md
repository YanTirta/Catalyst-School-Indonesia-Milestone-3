# **Review Milestone Reviewers feedback**
FP may review the project dashboard to see which milestones and PoA were approved/not approved.

All notifications will be visible in the To do list/Updates are sign-off notifications that will indicate if the milestones and PoA have been approved/not approved or received final approval from the Catalyst Team sign off user.

Milestone Reviewers feedback will be visible on the project dashboard. From there, FP will be easily able to see if milestones and PoA were approved/refused and if milestones were approved/partially approved/not approved.

## **Milestone approved**

If both Milestone Reviewers completely approved the milestone, FP will see a notification below on the project dashboard. FP will have to wait once the milestone is approved by the Catalyst Team sign off user to submit PoA.

## **Milestone partially approved**

If one Milestone Reviewer accepts the milestone but another refuses, the milestone is considered to be partially approved. In this situation, FP will see a notification below and has to resubmit the milestone as per Milestone Reviewers’ comments.

## **Milestone not approved**

If both Milestone Reviewers don’t approve the milestone, it will be refused. In this situation, FP will see the notification below on the project dashboard and must resubmit the milestone.
