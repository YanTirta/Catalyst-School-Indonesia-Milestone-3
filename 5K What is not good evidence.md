# **What is not good evidence?**

**General rules**

- The information provided does not clearly show that work was done in the month leading up to the report

- The links submitted do not work, so the project's evidence cannot be effectively verified 
   - E.g. Git repo is publicly accessible that will allow for review

- The report and evidence submitted is not in line with the Ideascale proposal
   - There have been changes made to the project in some way without approving the scope change
   - Project report is a duplicate of another previous report or another project altogether
   - The evidence contains projects description only, without any progress
   - Evidence is in different language than English
     - Process cannot accommodate other languages just yet

- Evidence is the same for different projects submitted by the same proposer

**Specific evidence**

- **If image/video is evidence:**
   - Quality is poor - unable to watch/see
   - Image wasn’t taken within time frame of progression month 
   - Lack of description

- **If code is evidence:**
   - It isn’t in the Git repository 
   - Activity in Github doesn’t match what stated in progress report

- **If presentation/slide is evidence:**
   - There is only project description, no track of any progression made within last month

- **If plan/task is evidence:**
   - List of task completed in the last month or description of/list of tasks for the future month only ( there should be both list current and future one), lack of supporting evidence attached

- **If website is evidence:**
   - No clear evidence of new features/updates on the website and their description

- **What if evidence is deemed as insufficient?**
   - If a project submits MR before the deadline, there is a better chance that Catalyst will inform a project via email that there is an issue with evidence provided. 
   - Email will raise what the issue is and request to address, ideally by re-submitting MR with the required information.
