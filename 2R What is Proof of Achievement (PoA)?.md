# **What is Proof of Achievement (PoA)?**
Under F10, Projects are required to deliver against their planned milestones throughout the lifespan of their project as outlined in the Statement of Milestones. When individual milestones are met, funded projects must submit Proof of Achievement (PoA). Proof of Achievement differs from the monthly progress reports that projects must submit during the project lifecycle. Proof of Achievement is essentially documentation that has to be submitted by the Projects showing that the acceptance criteria for a milestone as set out in the Statement of Milestones have been fulfilled and the milestone has been completed.

Funding is contingent on the Proof of Achievement being submitted and accepted as set out in this guide.
