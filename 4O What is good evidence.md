Below is the list of various evidence and the information on how they should look, which may be helpful for Milestone Reviewers:

### General evidence 
 * Evidence indicates what was done/accomplished in the milestone
 * There is a clear description of the evidence
 * All links are working, and Milestone Reviewer may open it

### Specific evidence
 * If image/video is evidence:
   * Is it high-quality and readable
   * The image/video has a clear description of why it was shared

### If code is evidence:
 * It is in the Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.), 
 * Checking if activity in Git matches what is stated in the report
   * number of commits
   * number of line codes addition/deletion
   * number of active users
   * number of releases

### If presentation/slide is evidence:
 * There is a description of what was achieved 

### If a website is evidence:
