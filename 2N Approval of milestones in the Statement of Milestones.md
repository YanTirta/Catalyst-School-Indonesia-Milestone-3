# **Approval of milestones in the Statement of Milestones**
Once completed, milestones in the Statement of Milestones will be reviewed and approved by Milestone Reviewers as part of the project onboarding and before the project is considered LIVE. Review and approval will be from 2 October to 9 October (from September 26 if FP finishes submission of milestones into the Milestone Module before the deadline)

More information on the process for obtaining approval for your Statement of Milestones in F10 is available here

The Statement of Milestones will continue to be monitored by Milestone Reviewers throughout project delivery. 

Under this framework, funding is conditional upon a Funded Project (FP) demonstrating that it has achieved the milestones set out in the Statement of Milestones.
