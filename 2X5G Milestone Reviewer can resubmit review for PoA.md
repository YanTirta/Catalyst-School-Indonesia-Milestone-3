# **Milestone Reviewer can resubmit review for PoA**
Milestone Reviewer can edit/change the review using the Resubmit review for this Proof of Achievement button. If a review is resubmitted, the previous one will be archived. Once PoA is approved by the Catalyst Team sign-off user, the review canâ€™t be resubmitted.
