# **Milestone Reviewer can review milestones**
Once a milestone is submitted by FP, the Milestone Reviewer will receive notifications in the Milestone module’s To-do list/Updates area. 

Milestone Reviewers won’t receive any email notifications. 

Reviewers must use the Open Milestone button to start the milestone review process and fill in the relevant fields. Once reviewed, the milestone to review will disappear from the To-do list/Updates area.

Clicking Submit review for this Milestone reveals new fields. Reviewers may decide which part of the milestone should be approved by ticking the checkbox and adding  comments. If some part is not approved, the checkbox shouldn’t be ticked, and comments should be added.
